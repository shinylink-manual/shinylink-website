### Code style

Since this is a collaborative project, please adhere to the following code formatting conventions:
* We use the tidyverse style guide (https://style.tidyverse.org/)
* Please write roxygen2 comments as full sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period. Brevity is preferred (e.g., "Calculates standard deviation" is preferred over "This method calculates and returns a standard deviation of given set of numbers").
